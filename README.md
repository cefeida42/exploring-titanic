# Exploring the famous "Titanic" dataset

This was my project for the university course "Processing and Analysis of Large Databases in Physics" which is a part of the MSc program in physics at Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad.

I utilize exploratory data analysis with `pandas` and apply several machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of the passengers using `scikit-learn` library. Finally, I compare the prediction accuracy of used algorithms using various metrics.
